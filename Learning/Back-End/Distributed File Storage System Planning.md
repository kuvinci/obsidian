### Planning and Design

1. **Define Project Scope**
    - Identify key features: file upload, download, delete, replication, and failure recovery.
    - Determine the scale of your distributed system: how many nodes initially?
2. **Research and Learning**
    - Brush up on Go syntax and best practices if it's new to you.
    - Understand basic concepts of distributed systems, consistent hashing, and replication strategies.
3. **System Architecture Design**
    - Sketch the system architecture, including client, nodes, and load balancer (if any).
    - Decide on the hashing algorithm for distributing files across nodes.
4. **Database Schema Design**
    - Design the database schema for storing file metadata, such as file name, size, hash, node location(s), etc.
    - Plan for scalability in your database design to accommodate future growth.
### Development Environment Setup

5. **Install Go and Set Up Development Environment**
    - Download and install Go.
    - Set up your IDE or text editor for Go development (e.g., Visual Studio Code with Go extension).
6. **Database Setup**
    - Install SQLite and familiarize yourself with its basic operations.
    - Create your initial database file and tables based on the schema you designed.

### Server and Node Implementation

7. **Basic Server Setup**
    - Implement a basic HTTP server in Go to handle file uploads, downloads, and deletions.
8. **File Handling Logic**
    - Develop the logic for processing file uploads, including calculating hashes and determining node locations.
    - Implement file download and deletion functionalities.
9. **Distributed System Logic**
    - Implement consistent hashing for distributing files across nodes.
    - Create the replication logic for copying files to multiple nodes for redundancy.
10. **Node Failure Handling**
    - Design and implement a strategy for detecting and recovering from node failures.

### Database Integration

11. **Database Connectivity**
    - Integrate SQLite with your Go application, ensuring your server can read from and write to the database.
12. **Metadata Management**
    - Implement functionality to store and retrieve file metadata in the database.

### Testing

13. **Unit Testing**
    - Write unit tests for your system's key components, such as file upload logic, hashing, and database operations.
14. **Integration Testing**
    - Test the system as a whole, ensuring all components work together seamlessly, especially under simulated node failure scenarios.
15. **Performance Testing**
    - Evaluate your system's performance, focusing on upload/download speeds and system behavior under load.

### Deployment

16. **Choose a Deployment Platform**
    - Research and select a cloud platform for deploying your system, considering cost and scalability.
17. **Deployment Setup**
    - Prepare your deployment environment, set up virtual machines or containers, and deploy your system.
18. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
    - Implement logging and monitoring to keep track of your system's health and performance.

### Documentation and Iteration

19. **Documentation**
    - Document your system architecture, API endpoints, and usage instructions.
20. **Feedback and Iteration**
    - Share your project with others, gather feedback, and iterate on your design and implementation to improve the system.
21. **Future Enhancements**
    - Consider potential enhancements, such as adding a front-end interface, implementing encryption for file storage, or exploring advanced replication and consistency models.
